# HarvestIQ: NextGen Crop Prediction via AI/ML

## 📌 Overview
HarvestIQ is a final-year B.Tech project developed by a 4-member team under the Smart India Hackathon (SIH) framework.  
The system leverages **Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Data Analytics** to provide **data-driven crop recommendations** across **28 Indian states/UTs and 23 crops**.  

By integrating soil health, weather forecasts, rainfall patterns, and historical yield records, HarvestIQ empowers farmers with **real-time, location-specific guidance** on crop selection, fertilizer use, and irrigation practices.

## 🚀 Features
- **AI/ML Models:** Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, Neural Networks, LSTM for weather-aware predictions.  
- **Data Scope:** 10–25 years of historical yield data + real-time weather and soil analytics.  
- **Preprocessing:** k-NN imputation, normalization, feature engineering (Agro-Climatic Index, Cost Index, Land-Efficiency Ratio).  
- **Accuracy:** Achieved up to **95% prediction accuracy** with CatBoost and Random Forest; reduced RMSE/MAE by **15–20%** compared to baselines.  
- **Platform:** Multilingual web & mobile interface with **REST APIs (FastAPI)** and secure authentication.  
- **Scalability:** Validated across diverse agro-ecological zones; designed for pan-India deployment.
